              "xxbos d of a conservative xxmaj republican faction in the xxup u.s. xxmaj congress , who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts , called himself a “ fiscal conservative ” on xxmaj sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018 . xxmaj in keeping with a sharp pivot under way among xxmaj republicans , xxup u.s. xxmaj representative xxmaj mark xxmaj meadows , speaking on xxup cbs ’ “ xxmaj face the xxmaj nation , ” drew a hard line on federal spending , which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in xxmaj january . xxmaj when they return from the holidays on xxmaj wednesday , lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues , such as immigration policy , even as the xxmaj november congressional election campaigns approach in which xxmaj republicans will seek to keep control of xxmaj congress . xxmaj president xxmaj donald xxmaj trump and his xxmaj republicans want a big budget increase in military spending , while xxmaj democrats also want proportional increases for non - defense “ discretionary ” spending on programs that support education , scientific research , infrastructure , public health and environmental protection . “ xxmaj the ( xxmaj trump ) administration has already been willing to say : ‘ xxmaj we ’re going to increase non -

long impasse that has raised fears on either side of the xxmaj channel that xxmaj britain could exit the bloc in 2019 without a deal on its future xxup eu ties . xxmaj these officials said they expected xxmaj may to signal soon that she would like to keep xxmaj britain in the single market for two to three years and was prepared to pay for the access . xxmaj however , they were unsure whether it would come in the xxmaj florence speech or later possibly during new xxmaj brexit negotiations next xxmaj monday , in early xxmaj october when she addresses her xxmaj conservative xxmaj party conference or at upcoming xxup eu summits in the xxmaj estonian capital xxmaj tallinn or in xxmaj brussels . xxmaj staying for three years in the customs union and single market would mean paying for it and xxmaj britain realizes that . xxmaj the acceptance of payments during that period would be a very big thing , said one xxup eu official close to the negotiations . xxmaj he was among more than half a dozen people involved with the issue in continental xxmaj europe who spoke to xxmaj reuters on xxmaj wednesday . xxmaj other officials were cautious , however , expressing concern that xxmaj britain was conflating two separate issues : the cost of continued market access after xxmaj brexit and the bill xxmaj london first needs to pay to settle its existing financial commitments . xxmaj if everything in the financial settlement is not covered then it will be difficult to move forward , said one official in xxmaj berlin , referring to a delicate moment in the talks . xxmaj three months into negotiations on the terms of xxmaj britain s departure from the xxup eu , the two sides are struggling to resolve the issues xxmaj brussels says must be addressed before talks on a future trading relationship can begin . xxmaj these include expatriate citizens rights , the xxmaj irish border and the financial bill tied to xxmaj britain s departure . xxmaj the xxup eu executive has estimated that xxmaj london may owe it around 60 billion euros due to commitments made during xxmaj british membership . xxmaj with the clock ticking down to the xxmaj march 2019 exit date , xxmaj britain is keen to start talks on its future trade relationship with the bloc to remove the cloud of uncertainty for companies that do business between xxmaj britain and the rest of the xxup eu . xxmaj without such certainty , companies in xxmaj britain may choose to move their operations to an xxup eu state to enjoy access to its single market of 440 million people . xxmaj some have already announced such plans . xxmaj talks on the future relationship were initially expected to start in xxmaj october . xxmaj but the xxup eu s chief negotiator , xxmaj frenchman xxmaj michel xxmaj barnier , has said that looks unrealistic so far . xxmaj he will meet his xxmaj british counterpart again on xxmaj monday in xxmaj brussels . xxmaj european officials sent conflicting signals on xxmaj wednesday about whether an acknowledgement of xxmaj britain s financial obligations during a post - xxmaj brexit transition period might be enough to break the logjam and open the door to deeper talks . xxmaj one senior official in a government broadly sympathetic to xxmaj britain said any offer of payment from xxmaj may could be positive and that other xxup eu leaders understood that she might seek to mix comments on exit and transition payments as a way to distract pro - xxmaj brexit voters at home away from concessions she might make . xxmaj the sense of reality has not yet arrived , a third senior xxup eu official said . xxmaj if i were xxmaj mrs xxmaj may i would make now a very , very clear offer , i would show my readiness . i m sure xxmaj may will give a nice speech in xxmaj florence , a second xxmaj german official added . xxmaj but what really counts is what the xxmaj british put on the table in xxmaj brussels on xxmaj monday .,xxbos xxup language xxup alert : xxmaj welfare xxmaj queen : xxmaj get out of here , b*tch . xxmaj f*ck the government . xxmaj f*ck xxmaj trump . i m gon na rape that sh*t sitting on my a$$ xxmaj guess what ? xxmaj this b*tch is doing better than you , b*tch . xxmaj you re on your feet all day b*tch . xxmaj all day xxmaj get the f*ck out of here . xxmaj you go and work . i ll sit on my a$$ while you go and work . xxup this xxup woman xxup should xxup be xxup tossed xxup in xxup jail xxmaj the hardworking xxmaj american taxpayers are supporting this horrible woman . xxmaj if xxmaj trump does anything at all , he should crack down on the freebies given to people like this . a single woman can make more money by just sitting around han she can if she works ! xxmaj there s something wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed xxunk government has incentivized having children because these single mothers get more government money per child . xxmaj we ve looked at the state of xxmaj new xxmaj york and here s what we found : xxup financial xxup help xxup for xxup single xxup mothers xxup in xxup ny xxup state : xxup ny xxup family xxup assistance xxup cash xxup payment xxup of $ xxunk xxup per xxup xxunk xxup stamps xxup up xxup to $ 1200 a xxup month xxup depending xxup on xxup number xxup in xxup xxunk xxup and xxup child xxup health xxup xxunk xxup another xxup food xxup xxunk xxup and xxup xxunk xxup food xxup care xxup program xxup provides xxup meals xxup for xxup kids xxup in xxup xxunk xxup child xxup xxunk xxup free xxup or xxup low -

xxmaj reid survey released on xxmaj thursday showed support for xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj bill xxmaj english s xxmaj national xxmaj party had edged down 1.5 points to 45.8 percent , but support for xxmaj labour also fell , dropping 0.5 points to 37.3 percent . xxmaj the xxmaj national xxmaj party has governed for the past nine years , and its re - election would xxunk investors who favour continuity and like xxmaj national s vow to keep the small trading economy open to foreign investment . xxmaj regardless of the polls , which have shown sharp xxunk , the nationalist xxmaj new xxmaj zealand xxmaj first xxmaj party could well emerge as the kingmaker in the next parliament . xxmaj minor parties often have an outsize role in xxmaj new xxmaj zealand s proportional representation system , in which a party , or combination of parties , needs 61 of xxmaj parliament s 120 members - usually about 48 percent of the vote - to form a government . xxmaj the xxmaj newshub - xxmaj reid survey showed support for xxmaj new xxmaj zealand xxmaj first hitting 7.1 percent , as did support for the xxmaj green xxmaj party , which is a likely coalition partner for xxmaj labour . xxmaj the tight race , with xxmaj labour and the xxmaj green xxmaj party virtually neck - and - neck with xxmaj national , meant the government might not be known for weeks . xxmaj despite all of the volatility , despite all the twists and turns of the campaign , it has come back to that simple fact ... xxmaj new xxmaj zealand xxmaj first appears to be that crucial kingmaker , said xxmaj bryce xxmaj edwards , analyst at xxmaj wellington - based xxmaj critical xxmaj politics . xxmaj outspoken xxmaj new xxmaj zealand xxmaj first leader xxmaj winston xxmaj peters has said he will not confirm which bloc of parties he ll support until xxmaj october 12 when the results become official . xxmaj the election was so hotly - contested that the deciding votes might be those of overseas xxmaj new xxmaj zealanders , whose ballots would not be released until xxmaj oct. 7 . xxmaj these votes , as well as those from xxmaj new xxmaj zealanders who voted outside of their home area , accounted for around 12 percent of total ballots cast in the 2014 election , according to the xxmaj election xxmaj commission . xxmaj labour leader xxmaj jacinda xxmaj ardern said on xxmaj wednesday that citizens living in xxmaj australia , home to xxmaj new xxmaj zealand s largest diaspora , were very important to the election . xxmaj most xxmaj new xxmaj zealanders maintain a strong interest in the direction of the country , particularly when it comes to things like how we re grappling with international issues , trade issues , environmental issues - so please have your say , xxmaj ardern told the xxmaj australian xxmaj broadcasting xxmaj corporation . xxmaj the xxmaj new xxmaj zealand dollar - the word s 11th most traded currency in 2016 - briefly firmed to $ xxunk from $ xxunk after xxmaj thursday s opinion poll , but quickly gave up most of those gains and sank to $ xxunk .,xxbos xxup u.s. xxmaj senate were dealt another blow in their effort to repeal xxmaj obamacare on xxmaj friday when the keeper of the xxmaj senate ’s rules said certain provisions in their healthcare bill , such as defunding xxmaj planned xxmaj parenthood , could not be included . xxmaj the xxmaj senate parliamentarian determined some provisions in the xxmaj better xxmaj care xxmaj reconciliation xxmaj act violate the xxmaj byrd xxmaj rule that requires backers to be able to muster 60 votes , according to a memo posted on the xxmaj senate xxmaj committee on the xxmaj budget website . xxmaj republicans , who control the xxmaj senate with a slim 52-seat majority , are unlikely to be able to round up that many votes for key provisions in the bill to repeal former xxmaj president xxmaj barack xxmaj obama ’s xxmaj affordable xxmaj care xxmaj act known as xxmaj obamacare . xxmaj affected would be the provision to defund xxmaj planned xxmaj parenthood , two provisions to prevent certain tax credits from being used to purchase health insurance that covers abortion , and a provision stating that beginning in 2020 states no longer have to cover essential health benefits in their xxmaj medicaid alternative benefit plans . xxmaj some provisions were not subject to the xxmaj byrd xxmaj rule , according to the parliamentarian , including a provision allowing states the option to impose work requirements on xxmaj medicaid enrollees who are not disabled , elderly or pregnant , and a proposal to repeal cost - sharing subsidies . xxmaj other provisions were still under review , including a proposal to allow insurers to charge older xxmaj americans more than younger people , a provision to allow small businesses to establish “ association health plans ” that could be sold across state lines and the option for states to receive xxmaj medicaid “ block grant ” lump sums instead of per capita cap payments . xxmaj senate xxmaj majority xxmaj leader xxmaj mitch mcconnell is seeking to use procedural rules that would allow xxmaj republicans to pass a healthcare bill with a simple majority in the .,xxbos xxmaj the majority of the country doesn t want xxmaj donald xxmaj trump as our president . a - list celebrities and even marching bands don t want to perform at his inauguration . xxmaj and now , his former campaign manager and newest counselor xxmaj kellyanne xxmaj conway is finding out that private schools in the xxup d.c. area don t want her kids either . xxmaj conway said on xxmaj wednesday that she is more amused than worried over the fact that none of the top notch schools in xxmaj washington want to accept her children . i would not characterize myself as worried so much as amused by the silence and xxunk on the other end of the phone when friends and allies have made preliminary inquiries on my behalf , xxmaj conway told the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj post . xxmaj conway then pointed out that many of these schools tout diversity in their xxunk . xxmaj for some , there is comfort in xxunk , she noted . xxmaj no wonder xxmaj trump likes her so much . xxmaj if i were an admissions counselor i d shy away from this too , but i digress . xxmaj nobody with any sense wants to be associated with xxmaj trump or his transition team in any way , shape , or form . xxmaj conway is known as a talented spin doctor who now spends her days trying to explain why the horrible things that come out of xxmaj trump s mouth ( or xxmaj twitter page ) couldn t possibly be as abhorrent as they seem on the surface . xxmaj conway said she has been shocked by the flood of people who have offered to help her and her family with their move to xxup d.c. , but top schools apparently aren t so eager . xxmaj according to the xxmaj post , a source close to xxmaj conway said that she is desperate and is asking everyone with connections to xxup d.c. schools for help . xxmaj whether or nor real estate agents in xxmaj washington will want to work with her remains to be seen , as when asked about the matter she simply replied : xxmaj first things first . xxmaj featured image via xxmaj drew xxmaj angerer / xxmaj getty xxmaj images,xxbos ropean capitals expect xxmaj british xxmaj prime xxmaj minister xxmaj theresa xxmaj may to try to break a deadlock in xxmaj brexit talks over the coming days by signaling a readiness to pay the xxup eu to stay in the single market for a time after it leaves the bloc . xxmaj senior officials dealing with xxmaj brexit in xxmaj brussels , xxmaj berlin and other capitals said they had not received any concrete overtures from xxmaj may ahead of a speech in xxmaj florence , xxmaj italy , on xxmaj friday , at which she is expected to flesh out her vision of xxmaj britain s future relationship with the xxmaj european xxmaj union . xxmaj and they played down a report in the xxmaj financial xxmaj times that her xxup eu adviser , xxmaj oliver xxmaj robbins , had informed xxmaj german xxmaj chancellor xxmaj angela xxmaj merkel and other leaders that xxmaj may could make an offer of 20 billion euros to cover a post - xxmaj brexit transition period . xxmaj we have not been informed in advance about any concrete negotiation offers from the xxmaj british government , a xxmaj german government spokesman said . xxmaj but the officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said they had received signals from xxmaj london that xxmaj may would try to break a months - long impasse that has raised fears on either side of the xxmaj channel that xxmaj britain could exit the bloc in 2019 without a deal on its future xxup eu ties . xxmaj these officials said they expected xxmaj may to signal soon that she would like to keep xxmaj britain in the single market for two to three years and was prepared to pay for the access . xxmaj however , they were unsure whether it would come in the xxmaj florence speech or later possibly during new xxmaj brexit negotiations next xxmaj monday , in early xxmaj october when she addresses her xxmaj conservative xxmaj party conference or at upcoming xxup eu summits in the xxmaj estonian capital xxmaj tallinn or in xxmaj brussels . xxmaj staying for three years in the customs union and single market would mean paying for it and xxmaj britain realizes that . xxmaj the acceptance of payments during that period would be a very big thing , said one xxup eu official close to the negotiations . xxmaj he was among more than half a dozen people involved with the issue in continental xxmaj europe who spoke to xxmaj reuters on xxmaj wednesday . xxmaj other officials were cautious , however , expressing concern that xxmaj britain was conflating two separate issues : the cost of continued market access after xxmaj brexit and the bill xxmaj london first needs to pay to settle its existing financial commitments . xxmaj if everything in the financial settlement is not covered then it will be difficult to move forward , said one official in xxmaj berlin , referring to a delicate moment in the talks . xxmaj three months into negotiations on the terms of xxmaj britain s departure from the xxup eu , the two sides are struggling to resolve the issues xxmaj brussels says must be addressed before talks on a future trading relationship can begin . xxmaj these include expatriate citizens rights , the xxmaj irish border and the financial bill tied to xxmaj britain s departure . xxmaj the xxup eu executive has estimated that xxmaj london may owe it around 60 billion euros due to commitments made during xxmaj british membership . xxmaj with the clock ticking down to the xxmaj march 2019 exit date , xxmaj britain is keen to start talks on its future trade relationship with the bloc to remove the cloud of uncertainty for companies that do business between xxmaj britain and the rest of the xxup eu . xxmaj without such certainty , companies in xxmaj britain may choose to move their operations to an xxup eu state to enjoy access to its single market of 440 million people . xxmaj some have already announced such plans . xxmaj talks on the future relationship were initially expected to start in xxmaj october . xxmaj but the xxup eu s chief negotiator , xxmaj frenchman xxmaj michel xxmaj barnier , has said that looks unrealistic so far . xxmaj he will meet his xxmaj british counterpart again on xxmaj monday in xxmaj brussels . xxmaj european officials sent conflicting signals on xxmaj wednesday about whether an acknowledgement of xxmaj britain s financial obligations during a post - xxmaj brexit transition period might be enough to break the logjam and open the door to deeper talks . xxmaj one senior official in a government broadly sympathetic to xxmaj britain said any offer of payment from xxmaj may could be positive and that other xxup eu leaders understood that she might seek to mix comments on exit and transition payments as a way to distract pro - xxmaj brexit voters at home away from concessions she might make . xxmaj the sense of reality has not yet arrived , a third senior xxup eu official said . xxmaj if i were xxmaj mrs xxmaj may i would make now a very , very clear offer , i would show my readiness . i m sure xxmaj may will give a nice speech in xxmaj florence , a second xxmaj german official added . xxmaj but what really counts is what the xxmaj british put on the table in xxmaj brussels on xxmaj monday .,xxbos xxup language xxup alert : xxmaj welfare xxmaj queen : xxmaj get out of here , b*tch . xxmaj f*ck the government . xxmaj f*ck xxmaj trump . i m gon na rape that sh*t sitting on my a$$ xxmaj guess what ? xxmaj this b*tch is doing better than you , b*tch . xxmaj you re on your feet all day b*tch . xxmaj all day xxmaj get the f*ck out of here . xxmaj you go and work . i ll sit on my a$$ while you go and work . xxup this xxup woman xxup should xxup be xxup tossed xxup in xxup jail xxmaj the hardworking xxmaj american taxpayers are supporting this horrible woman . xxmaj if xxmaj trump does anything at all , he should crack down on the freebies given to people like this . a single woman can make more money by just sitting around han she can if she works ! xxmaj there s something wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed xxunk government has incentivized having children because these single mothers get more government money per child . xxmaj we ve looked at the state of xxmaj new xxmaj york and here s what we found : xxup financial xxup help xxup for xxup single xxup mothers xxup in xxup ny xxup state : xxup ny xxup family xxup assistance xxup cash xxup payment xxup of $ xxunk xxup per xxup xxunk xxup stamps xxup up xxup to $ 1200 a xxup month xxup depending xxup on xxup number xxup in xxup xxunk xxup and xxup child xxup health xxup xxunk xxup another xxup food xxup xxunk xxup and xxup xxunk xxup food xxup care xxup program xxup provides xxup meals xxup for xxup kids xxup in xxup xxunk xxup child xxup xxunk xxup free xxup or xxup low -
