# Fake-News-Classifier

## Inspiration
Recently, with the explosion of social media, the issue of fake news has become extremely prevalent, resulting in many illegal and dangerous activity. Fake or misleading news can have a real impact on those who find themselves the targets. When disinformation is repeated and amplified, including by influential people, the grave danger is that information which is based on truth, ends up having only marginal impact. This projects aims to detect any such fake news that might have spread due to social networking and social messaging platforms.

## What it does
Fake News Detector is a web app which allows you to verify whether a certain news related to Corona is true or false. It provides a simplistic, user friendly interface in which users simply have to enter the text of the news which they want to verify and the model will process the text input in terms of True or False. 

## How we built it
The model was trained using fastai. The web app was built using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

## Challenges we ran into
The data set used in building this application was extremely biased and required significant formatting to make it usable. In addition to this, there were a few difficulties in using fastai as we were working with it for the first time.
We tried to make a simple UI for deploying and using the app on web. However, we faced a lot of difficulties in deploying the model. We were successful in making a UI for the app, but we could not link the model to the web app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were immensely proud to create an application that allows people to verify the authenticity of different news reports regarding COVID 19 and this, in turn, would significantly improve the trustworthiness of information found online. 

## What we learned
We learned how to train models using fastai. Moreover, concept of flask was also new to us.

## What's next for Fake News Detection
Several measures have been put in place to curb the circulation of fake news. The World Health Organisation uses its existing network called EPI-WIN to track down misinformation in several languages. It also asks technology giants to filter out false news and promote information from credible sources. In order to distinguish effectively between authentic and false data, we need larger data sets. 
We will be working towards converting the model into a web app and deploying it so that people can use it in their daily lives and benefit from it.
